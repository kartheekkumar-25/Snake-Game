# Snake-Game
A classic Snake Game built using Python’s turtle module. The game features smooth movement, random food generation, score tracking, and game-over detection when the snake hits the wall or collides with itself. The project follows an object-oriented design with separate modules for the snake, food, and scoreboard.
